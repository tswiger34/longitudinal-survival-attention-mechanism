"""Survival loss functions used by the LTSA training pipeline.

This module provides discrete-time and Cox-style losses for right-censored
survival analysis:

- `nll_loss`: negative log-likelihood for discrete hazard predictions.
- `ce_surv_loss`: cross-entropy-style survival loss with an NLL-style
  regularization term.
- `cox_surv_loss`: Cox partial log-likelihood objective.

It also exposes callable wrapper classes (`NLLSurvLoss`, `CrossEntropySurvLoss`, and `CoxSurvLoss`) to support
object-style loss configuration in training code.

  discrete-time losses.
- `Y`: discrete event/censor bin indices, shape `(batch_size,)` or `(batch_size, 1)`.

    """Negative log-likelihood survival loss for discrete-time survival models.

    This function computes the negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss for discrete-time survival analysis. The model
    predicts hazard probabilities for each time interval, and the loss evaluates how well those predicted hazards
    match the observed event times and censoring indicators.

    The loss combines contributions from:
    - **Uncensored observations**: log-likelihood of surviving up to the
      event time and failing at that interval.
    - **Censored observations**: log-likelihood of surviving beyond the
      censoring interval.

    Args:
        hazards (Tensor):
            Predicted hazard probabilities for each observation and time bin. The shape should be
            `(batch_size, num_time_bins)` and the values should be in the range `[0, 1]`

        S (Tensor):
            Survival probabilities corresponding to `hazards`. Shape `(batch_size, num_time_bins)`. Should equal
            the cumulative product of `(1 - hazards)` along the time dimension. If `None`, then computed internally

        Y (Tensor):
            Ground-truth event time indices for each observation. Each value indicates the discrete time
            bin in which the event or censoring occurred. Shape should be `(batch_size,)` or `(batch_size, 1)`

        c (Tensor):
            Censoring indicator for each observation where:
                - ``0`` = event observed
                - ``1`` = right-censored

            Shape ``(batch_size,)`` or ``(batch_size, 1)``.
        beta (float, optional):
            Weight applied to the uncensored loss component. This can help stabilize training
            by emphasizing event observations relative to censored observations. Defaults to `0.15`

        eps (float, optional):
            Small constant used to clamp probabilities before taking the logarithm, preventing numerical
            instability from `log(0)`. Defaults to `1e-7`.

        **kwargs:
            Additional keyword arguments included for API compatibility. These values are ignored.

    """Cross-entropy survival loss for discrete-time survival models.

    This loss function combines a cross-entropy formulation of survival likelihood with a regularization component
    derived from the negative log-likelihood of the discrete hazard formulation.

    The loss consists of two components:

    1. **Cross-entropy survival term (`ce_l`)**
       - For censored observations: encourages the model to assign high
         survival probability at the censoring time.
       - For uncensored observations: encourages the model to assign high
         probability of failure at the observed event interval.

    2. **Regularization term (`reg`)**
       - Equivalent to the discrete hazard negative log-likelihood used in
         standard survival modeling.

    The parameter ``beta`` controls the contribution of the regularization component relative to the cross-entropy
    survival term.
